<b>Why Build WaveScrape?</b>
<p>
  Surfer Talk: As a surfer, one of the biggest challenges is figuring out the best place to paddle out at. And to answer this questions, there's a lot of variables to consider. <br> 
  • which way the swell is pushing, <br>
  • how big is the swell, <br>
  • what are the tide heights, <br> 
  • what's the water temp, <br>
  • what's the air temp, <br>
  • wind conditions, <br>
  • day light hours, <br>
  • etc etc. <br>
  And you can answer this questions <u>accurately</u> by going to specific websites that dial into each variable. I wanted an all inclusive webapp that had the same accurate, dialed-in information.

  Nerd Shit:
  As a software engineer, I wanted to expand my knowledge of code and programming. One method I find most helpful is by building a project that challenges my abilities into fields I'm interested in. In the case of WaveScrape, my primary interests are in learning more about: <br>
  modern full-stack Javascript app development, <br>
  clean, orthogonal, & modular codebase structure, <br>
  automated CI/CD DevOps, <br>
  cloud/serverless functions, and <br>
  web scraping. <br>
  One thing that makes this project unique, is that I'm suiting project to tools because (in this case) I'm more interested in developing my skills with these tools than I am with "delivering a product".

<b>How it Works</b>
<p>
  Surfer Talk:
  Essentially for each variable, I find the most accurate website resource. Then I scrape that public information into this webapp. Hence, the name WaveScrape
</p>
<p>
  Nerd Talk:
  I use Node.js and cloud/serverless functions (with Google Cloud Platform) to scrape others websites' public data with Puppeteer.js. Once data is scraped, it passed into a key-value store (aka noSQL database) with Google's Cloud Firestore. These functions are triggered daily, to scrape the most accurate/recent data. 

  On the frontend I'm using Angular Ivy. When a user queries for certain data, the frontend app calls to that key-value store, returning the queried data.
